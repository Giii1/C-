# C++

In this project we made use of the int data type suggests that the variable can only hold integers. 
Similarly, we also use the double data type if we have to store decimals and exponentials.
The const keyword was also created as a variable whose value cannot be changed.
Also the 'cout' object along with the "<<" operator for was used for displaying output.In order for this to work, 
we first include the iostream header file that allows us to display output.
The 'cout' object is defined inside the std namespace. To use the std namespace, we used the using namespace std; statement.
The code execution begins from the start of the main() function.
  Moreover, we also made used of both 'private' and 'public' keyword.
This means the members are public and can be accessed anywhere from the program if the 'public' keyword is used. 
Likewise, we also create private members using the 'private' keyword. The private members of a class can only be accessed from within the class.
And lastly, the if...else statement to create decision making programs.
